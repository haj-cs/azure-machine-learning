# Azure Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains multiple Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio projects completed as part of my BSc Computer Science degree. These projects demonstrate use of regression, classification, clustering, and computer vision models.

 Regression – Walmart Weekly Sales Prediction
- Built a multiple linear regression model to predict retail sales.
- Preprocessed the dataset using Select Columns, Clean Missing Data, and Normalize Data.
- Evaluated model performance with R², MSE, RSA and RAE.
- Implemented real-time inference pipelines.

Classification – Titanic Survival Prediction
- Created a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival.
- Cleaned and normalised data to improve model performance.
- Achieved 66% accuracy, 72% precision.

Clustering – Iris Flower Dataset
- Used K-Means clustering (K=3) on Iris dataset.
- Removed labels for true unsupervised learning.
- Analysed cluster distances and separation metrics.

Computer Vision – Landmark Classification
- Used Azure Custom Vision to classify images of:
  - Taj Mahal
  - Burj Khalifa
  - Eiffel Tower
- Achieved strong accuracy after several training iterations.
